<h3 align="center">Dental Pure - Work in progress</h3>


</div>

A WebApp for dentist studio, that can by used by its clients to book an appointment online, 
learn more about doctors that work there and read information about pricing. All of these information are loaded from the database.  
The client side of things is mostly complete now, so the next step will be to add an admin account that can add or remove staff members directly from the site, change pricing and see booked client visits. The last step is to improve user UI - design of the site. The webpage looks a little bit rough right now, but it can be improved at the end.   
My main focus is functionality and maintaining good coding practices.

Some of the technologies, patterns, programming languages etc used in the project include:  
-C#  
-Bootstrap  
-Html  
-CSS  
-ASP.NET Core MVC architecture  
-Repository Pattern  
-N-Tier Architecture  
-Dependency Injection  
-Entity framework  
-SQL Server  
-SweetAlert (not yet included)
